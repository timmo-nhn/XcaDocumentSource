## Solution Documentation

### [⚙️ Technical implementation details](/Docs/TechnicalImplementation.md)
How **PJD.XcaDocumentSource** solution is structured, and how it can be implemented in a source system, takin in account existing document registries/repositories, and PAP/PDP/PR systems.

### [🧾 Metadata, XDS and SOAP-message formats and standards](/Docs/XdsAndSoap.md)
Covering the SOAP-message format and the XDS profile and transactions involved in uploading, downloading and sharing documents and document metadata.

### [🏥 HL7 Messaging and Patient identity](/Docs/Hl7MessagingPatientIds.md)
Desrcribes the lightweight implementation of HL7 messaging, allowing for Patient Demographics and Identity lookups and cross-referencing

## Introduction
This document will describe the Norwegian usage and profilings of the IHE integration profiles based on XDS, XCA and XUA provided in Volumes 1 through 3 of the [IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework ↗](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/index.html) in a national context.
Patient Health Records (PHR) facilitates Cross enterprise document sharing between health professionals and between health professionals and citizens in Norway. The main objectives of PHR are:  

* Give health professionals necessary access to referrals, discharge summaries and other types of reports (documents) stored in other healthcare enterprises to achieve more effective health care decisions and reduce errors.
* Reduce the administrative burden and costs of today's collection and delivery of health information.
* Increase the overview of available health information across enterprises.
* Enable access to patients to their medical records throughout Norway.

## Document sharing - Actors and components  
The **XDS-architecture** consists of the following actors/components:


### Document source  
A document source is typically an **EHR-system** or backend solution which has produced or stores a document which will be shared using the **XDS-solution**.


### Document consumer  
A document consumer is typically a **EHR-system** (or citizen portal) which queries the **Document Source** for documents on a given patient.


### Document repository
A document repository is the service responsible for storing or making the document accessible. an **XDS-solution** can consist of one or more document repositories.


### Document Registry  
The Document Registry contains information (metadata) about all archived documents in the XDS area served by this document repository. An XDS site is always served by only one document repository, but a document repository can cover multiple XDS areas.
In addition to metadata about existing documents, the document register contains pointers to the document archive where the document is stored.


### Affinity Domain  
The concept of an Affinity Domain is, literally and figuratively, central in the realm of sharing health documents. The XDS-profile describes how documents are shared across enterprise boundaries within an Affinity Domain, as well as the rules that make sharing possible. An Affinity Domain has its own unique identifier, known as a **HomeCommunityID**. This ID is used when querying the domain.  
The boundaries of an Affinity Domain is not specified, but a logical separation within a country is natural. In Norway, this separation is on a **RHF** (Regionalt helseforetak)-level. This level of separation makes it possible for the Affinity Domains to profilings catered towards the needs of both the domain, aswell as the **RHF**.


### Patient identity source  
This component ensures every patient is given an **unambigous identificator**, for example a local, regional or nationwide population register.
>**🚩 National Extension**<br> In Norway, a personal identificator is in use (person number), so a dedicated service for handling patient identifications is not required.


## Object Identifiers (OID)
>**Note:** For OIDs to effectively work, there must be some level of governance when creating and managing OIDs. Norsk helsenett (NHN) should have a comprehensive overview of the OIDs related to PHR. NHN shall be informed of the OID of a new document source.

OID (Object Identifiers) are unique identifiers for objects or things. **Anything can have an OID, and an OID is nothing more than a set of numbers and dots (.) which make up a hierarchical structure**. In PHR, OIDs are used to unambiguously identify a system or facility. The OIDs might get translated by the systems into the actual URL, which means the URL can change, but the OID stays the same. OIDs are also used in logging. OIDs have a "tree/path"-like structure, and can be represented by its numerical or text variant.  
More about OIDs on [NHN's Developer portal ↗](https://utviklerportal.nhn.no/informasjonstjenester/pasientens-journaldokumenter-i-kjernejournal/mer-om-tjenesten/oider/) (In Norwegian).  

### Governing Object Identifiers
Even though OIDs are simply numbers and dots, its the way that its governed and controlled which defines its effectiveness in practice. Having good control over an OID structure leads to effective communication and identification.   

>**🔶 Implementation Note x** <br> In **PJD.XcaDocumentSource**, OIDs are used for **RepositoryID** and **HomecommunityID**.

The **Norwegian profile of IHE XDS metadata** defines the use of OIDs for identifying communities. Norsk helsenett (NHN) governs an OID-base and is the primary issuer of an OID to a community. Each Norwegian health region also governs their own OIDbase and can choose to issue their own homecommunity ID.  
The OID-base which NDE governs has the following OID structure for document sharing:
* 2.16.578.1.12.4.1.7 – Document sharing root OID
  * 2.16.578.1.12.4.1.7.1 – Community base OIDs governed by NHN
    * 2.16.578.1.12.4.1.7.1.1 – National community
> **⚠️ Alert x:** <br> Historically, this OID-base has belonged to The Norwegian Directorate of eHealth (NDE/e-Helse) for PHR (formely known as Dokumentdeling)

## Document consuming process
Below is a diagram showing the process of retrieving the document-list and the document. Each affinity domain has its own XCA, which again has its own registry and repositories.  
When querying for a list of documentr , the Registry is queried, as it holds the metadata and references to the documents in the repository. When retrieving a document, the repository is queried with the ID from the Registry metadata item of interest.
