# PJD.XcaDocumentSource ‚Äì Open Source XCA Responding Gateway Adapter Framework

## Preface: The vision of PJD.XcaDocumentSource
> ‚ö† **Important Note!** <br>**PJD.XcaDocumentSource** is provided as an open-source reference for the implementer to extend or customize its interfaces to align with the requirements of their existing Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems.  
The solution is **not** a substitute for an EPR system nor an EPR storage solution; it acts as a translating framework between SOAP messages from NHN's XCA and the implementers **existing** EPR-system.<br><br></span>
**Norsk helsenett (NHN) does not assume responsibility for the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of patient data handled through deployments based on PJD.XcaDocumentSource. Use of PJD.XcaDocumentSource is at the implementer's own risk, and any integration between PJD.XcaDocumentSource and live Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems must be thoroughly tested and validated within the implementer‚Äôs own governance and compliance frameworks.**

**PJD.XcaDocumentSource** allows healthcare providers to expose their internal, **existing document storage solution** as an **XDS-compliant Registry** and **Repository** interface.  
The solution serves as a protocol adapter layer that abstracts **SOAP**, **ebXML**, and **ebRIM** formatted messages behind a simplified **RESTful API layer**. This significantly reduces integration friction with an actor's existing storage solution, by translating complex ITI messages into implementation-defined, simplified internal representations suitable for integration with custom document APIs.

* Implements IHE XCA profile for cross-community access
* Provides an XDS.b-compatible registry and repository layer backed by customizable storage adapters
* Supports integration with Norsk Helsenett‚Äôs XCA Initiating Gateway

**PJD.XcaDocumentSource** does not provide document storage itself. Instead, it allows implementers to connect their own storage infrastructure - whether proprietary, legacy, or standards-based‚Äîby implementing custom translation logic between document storage metadata and the simpler, internal data-structures.

```

It aims to accelerate prototyping and integration with NHN, without requiring full knowledge of **IHE profiles** and **ebXML RegRep** specifications up-front; the solution handles the complexities of SOAP and XML, essentially "doing the plumbing work". This allows the end user to focus on their domain-specific implementations needs, like shaping business logic and handling access control.

Architecturally, **PJD.XcaDocumentSource** acts as a translation gateway that sits between an external XCA Initiating Gateway (e.g., NHN) and an organization‚Äôs internal EPR system, mapping IHE protocols to local API formats.


## Introduction/Getting started
In the healthcare industry, hospitals, clinics, and municipalities use a variety of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, often from different vendors. These systems were rarely designed to communicate with each other, leading to:
* Data silos where patient records are confined in local systems
* Manual, error-prone processes for sharing health information
* Delayed treatment due to lack of access to complete medical histories  

This lack of interoperability results in documents having to be shared via manual routines, such as fax-machines, sent as letters via taxi or calling the hospitals a patient has previously visited. This results in fragmented care, increased administrative burden, and risk to patient safety.

**PJD.XcaDocumentSource** is a component which acts as a middleware-system between healthcare provider system and Norsk helsenett's XCA-gateway infrastructure. This will allow actors such as hospitals and municipalities to share patient health records across organizational and technical boundaries by handling the SOAP-implementation, and allowing the implementer to easily modify the solution to for integrating between **PJD.XcaDocumentSource** and their own systems.  
The implementation is based around the IHE integration profiles based on **XDS** and **XCA** provided in Volumes 1 through 3 of the [IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework - profiles.ihe.net ‚Üó](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/index.html) in a national context, aswell as **HL7** and **XACML**:

* XDS.b (Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing) ‚Äì for registering and retrieving clinical documents
* XCA (Cross-Community Access) Responding Gateway ‚Äì for querying and retrieving documents from NHN's XCA  
* HL7 (Health Level 7) version 2 - for some queries related to patient identity
* PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) - for access control (XACML-implementation)

## Coding Conventions

The following coding conventions are used in XcaDocumentSource. They are not enforced onto the implementer, but described here for informational purposes:
- Functions are used extensively to break up code and separate concerns. Functions should rarely be more than 100 lines.
  - Functions should have a single purpose (SRP)
- Service-classes encapsulate functionality related to a single "purpose" or function (interact with registry/repository, transform objects from X to Y format etc.)
- Naming:
  - `PascalCase` for classes, methods, and public properties.
  - `camelCase` for local variables and private fields.
- File structure: One class per file.
- Indentation: 4 spaces (no tabs).
- Uses `async/await` over `Task.ContinueWith`, no `.Result` or `.Wait()`.
- Avoid abbreviations in names (e.g., `userProfile`, not `usrProf`, can be abbreviated for long variable names).

### Separation of concerns
The code is divided into clear layers (API/controller, Service, Wrapper, Domain(classes))
```
/Controllers
  - RegistryController.cs
/Services
  - RegistryService.cs
/Repositories
  - RegistryWrapper.cs
```
